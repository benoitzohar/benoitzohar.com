# Enabling dark mode

> Empowering my visitor's battery with dark mode.

## Why am I doing this?

I firmly believe that batteries are the main liability of any "modern" device. The company, or person, who will manage to store our energy in a truly efficient way is going to change the way we live.

In the meantime, saving energy can be perceived as a performance enhancement, just not the kind of enhancement you would expect when we talk about performances for the web.

OLED screens can drastically reduce the usage of our battery by not requiring every pixel on the screen to consume the same amount of energy. By making more pixels darker, we will reduce the enery consumption of the screen. 

Although the screen [won't be totally neutral in terms of energy](https://www.oled-info.com/google-details-oled-power-consumption-shows-how-androids-dark-mode-can-help-extend-your-battery-life) if it's entirely black, the darker the better.

## Targetting dark mode devices with css

Saving battery life is good, but we don't want to see websites which are **entirely dark** all the time.
 
To target only dark mode capable devices, and to target them only when they **actually are** in dark mode, we can use the nifty [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.
 
By adding a few line of css, we can change the look of our entire page:
 
```css
 @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```
 
That css will only be used when the user's device is in dark mode.
 
The [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) is already on the latest browser, which means it will probably works well on all dark mode enabled OSes.
